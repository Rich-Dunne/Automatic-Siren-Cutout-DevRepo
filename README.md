# Installation
Drag and drop the contents of the downloaded GTA V folder into where your GTA V is installed.  If you don't follow these directions and don't put InputManager.dll in your GTA V folder, this plugin will not work.  Ensure the controls in AutomaticSirenCutout.ini match the keys you use to exit your vehicle, scroll through the ELS lighting stages, honk your horn, and operate your manual siren.

If you experience a bug where your lights flash and/or siren blips while getting out of your car when the lights are off, ensure that ELS Lock is disabled (default Scroll Lock key).
